CONFORMATION SEARCH USING CHARMM

Description
-----------

This set of scripts performs a replica exchange molecular dynamics 
(a.k.a., parallel tempering) simulation of a molecule using the CHARMM 
molecular mechanical modeling code. The final structures of the simulations 
are then minimized. This provides a method to find low-energy conformations 
of a molecule.


Requirements
------------

These scripts use several other molecular modeling programs in combination 
to generate the initial coordinates, molecular structure, topology, and 
parameters. For the example calculation to work, the following software 
must be installed:
* CHARMM (http://www.charmm.org/)
   * tested with version c38b2
* Antechamber (part of AmberTools, http://ambermd.org/)
   * tested with AmberTools14
* OpenBabel  (http://openbabel.org)
   * only required when building molecules from SMILES strings or other 
     formats that are not supported by antechamber 
   * tested with version 2.3.2 
The executables for these programs (CHARMM, antechamber, and obabel) are 
assumed to be in the path when the script is run.


Compiling CHARMM
----------------

This system requires that CHARMM be run in parallel using MPI. CHARMM must be 
compiled with MPI parallelization and the replica exchange features (repdstr).
To use the semi-empirical QM module of CHARMM  to represent the molecule, the 
SQ keyword must be used. The suggested command line for compiling CHARMM for 
use with these scripts is:

./install.com gnu large M MPIF90 SQ +REPDSTR +GENCOMM  +CMPI

After compilation is completed, you should copy the charmm executable to the 
working directory or modify the conformation-search.sh script so that the 
fully-qualified path is included in used at both instances.


Options
-------

The execution options for this script are specified in the file settings.str
* NREPLICAS
   * Specifies the number of replicas to simulation in the REMD simulation
   * This should not exceed the number of processors available to be run in 
     parallel
   * A sufficient number of replicas must be used so that neighbouring 
     replicas are  close in temperatures
   * Default value: 20
* LOWT
   * Specifies the temperature of the lowest temperature replica in Kelvin
   * If you are searching for the global potential energy minimum, this should
     be sufficiently low so that only lowest energy conformation is likely to 
     be populated at the lowest temperature; however, larger temperature 
     ranges need more replicas.
   * Default value: 50 
* HIGHT
   * Specifies the temperature of the lowest temperature replica in Kelvin
   * The inclusion of high temperature replicas; however, if it is set too 
     high (e.g. > 1000 K), the simulation can become numerically unstable 
     and non-physical isomerizations can occur (e.g. rotations around double 
     bonds), especially in QM simulations.
   * Default value: 500 
* NSTEPS
   * Specifies the number of time steps steps to perform. Each time step is 1 
     fs in length (1 fs = 10âˆ’15 s). This should be sufficiently large to allow
     the simulation to find the lowest energy conformation.
   * Default value: 1000000
* XFREQ
   * The number of time steps between replica exchange attempts
   * Default value: 1000 
* QM
   * Defines whether to represent the molecule with an molecular mechanical 
     model (QM = 0) or with a semi-empirical quantum mechanical model (QM = 1)
   * Default value: 0
* QMCHARGE
   * Stores the net charge of the molecule for QM calculations
   * Default value: 0
* QMMETHOD
   * Specifies which semi-empirical QM method to use in QM calculations. The 
     options are limited to am1, pm3, or mndo
   * Default value: pm3


Execution
---------

The directory must contain mol.rtf, where the molecule that conformational 
search is being performed on is defined as "RESI MOL". The directory must 
also contain a file, mol.prm, that contains. It is recommended to use 
antechamber to generate these parameters from the Generalized Amber Force 
Field (GAFF), although these parameters will be ignored when a QM model is 
used.

mpirun -np 20 charmm < remd.inp > remd.out


It may be necessary to modify the mpirun command line to point to the host 
file or the correct path for the version of mpirun used in the compilation. 
By default, the simulation will use 20 replicas on When the simulation 
completes, the minimum energy structure is saved to the files min_pdb_# 
in PDB format. The energy of this conformation is stored in the first line 
of these files. The structure of the minimum temperature structure (min_pdb_0)
will often be the lowest energy structure, although it is possible that one of
the higher temperature replicas will hold the lowest energy structure.

When a QM method is used, it becomes possible for chemical reactions to occur
in high temperature replicas, so isomerizations and fragmentations can occur. 
This can be prevented by adding restraints to the remd.inp script to prevent 
specific thermally accessible reaction mechanisms or by using a lower maximum 
temperature in the replica exchange.


Example
-------

The included example builds maltose from its SMILES string, then uses CHARMM 
to perform a replica exchange conformation search. This example is executed 
by:

cd example
./conformation-search.sh

The lowest energy conformation will be written to min_pdb_0.
